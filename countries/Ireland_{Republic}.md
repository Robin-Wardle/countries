## interesting trivia
St. Patrick wasn't Irish, he was born in Great Britain and is likely native to Wales, Scotland or England
St. Bridget, however, is an official Irish Saint and is well known for her charitable nature and hospitality to 
the poorer folk of Ireland
The potato famine was caused by Queen Elizabeth in an effort to crush the Irish spirit so the people of Ireland 
are less likely to be a threat to the ruling English crown
The stone fences found in Irish countryside are plentiful because during the potato famine people needed work 
and building stone fences were a form of work. Regardless of excess fence, it was a job and there was payment.
Along with causing the potato famine, in order to further crush Irish spirit Queen Elizabeth ordered that all 
harps be destroyed as they were a national symbol to Ireland. The oldest harp in existence remains in Trinity 
Hall in Dublin.
